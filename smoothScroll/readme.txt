For one of my projects I came up with a simple jQuery example to create a smooth scrolling effect.

Whatever anchor element <a> has the scroll class assigned to it, it will inherit a click event that will auto scroll to the specified anchor. The anchor must have an id and the name that is the same in order for the scroll to work.
My solution is a mash up of various solutions found on the internet, but this variation worked for me.

Hope you find my example as easy to use as I did.
