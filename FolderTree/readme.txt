Today I thought that I would put together a simple jQuery folder menu for myself to use in projects to come.  
It is easily modified,   easy to create dynamically and easily styled.  The jQuery script portion is rather 
simple and has been tested on Chrome, FireFox and IE. This is another step in the direction of building a 
base library of scripts for me to use.
